# calculator-Complex

~This project is about is simple application that performs basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

~The project was created using Kotlin programming language and the Android Studio development environment to create the application.

~The calculator will have a minimalist design with a clean and intuitive user interface that makes it easy to use.
The application will have a single activity with a layout that includes buttons for the digits, decimal point, and mathematical operations.
The user will be able to input the numbers and operations using the buttons, and the calculator will display the result in real-time.

~The project will be well-organized and follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the application logic and data from the user interface. 
The user interface will be defined in an XML layout file, and the application logic will be implemented in a separate class.

~Overall, the Calculator Project using Kotlin will be a useful and practical application that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations. 
The application will demonstrate the use of stack-based algorithms and follow best practices for Android development, 
making it a good starting point for learning more advanced concepts and features in Kotlin and Android app development.

~Hope you like it!

~ Looking forward to collaborating, making corrections where possible and necessary.
